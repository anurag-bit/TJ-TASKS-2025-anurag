Farmer John has an integer x. He creates a sequence of length n by alternating integers x and −x, starting with x.

For example, if n=5, the sequence looks like: x,−x,x,−x,x.

He asks you to find the sum of all integers in the sequence.

Input:
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤100)  — the number of test cases.

The only line of input for each test case is two integers x and n (1≤x,n≤10).

Output:
For each test case, output the sum of all integers in the sequence.

Example:
Input:
4
1 4
2 5
3 6
4 7

Output:
0
2
0
4
